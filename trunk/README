				  Dupmanager
		http://developer.berlios.de/projects/dupmanager/

Dupmanager was made out of desperation, having tried a few different duplicate file
finders and them not doing exactly what I want it to do without having to write more
buggy C code. So, this is written in shell, which is extremely easy to shape and mold
into what you want it to do. This is a community effort, as such I won't be fixing bugs
unless they bother me, and if I add features it's scratching my own itch. I'm more than
willing to take bug fixes, or add features from others, but I will need a patch. You 
can send an email to me (see AUTHORS).

Adding components to this is extremely simple. It's written in bash and only uses
coreutils if possible, with as few as possible regex's.

So far, as of 1.0 all it does is get information and make a report. It could easily
do a few very useful things including, but not limited to:
	* Script to delete certain files
	* Report how much space could be gained by removing duplicated
	* Interactive mode
	* and much more...

Before it does something like that it should be a little more abstract, perhaps
putting all values into a few arrays and parse and add as necessary.

Developers: If you're going to add a patch, please make a function to do your work,
keep it nice and simple. If you're going to add a new component that does something 
specific please add it as a getopts(). Also if you're going to add something 
that has a chance of being dangerous to the user, make it difficult for the user to
screw up. Finally, if adding to it, it must act like any normal GNU style C 
application.
